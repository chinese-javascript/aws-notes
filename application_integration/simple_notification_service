# Simple Notification Service (SNS) Overview
Amazon SNS manages the delivery of messages to subscribing endpoints or clients. *Publishers* communicate asynchronously with *subscribers* by producing and sending a message to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel. Subscribers consume the message over one of the supported protocols (e.g. SQS, HTTP/S, email, SMS, Lambda) when they are subbed to a topic.
