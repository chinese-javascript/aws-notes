# Simple Storage Service

S3 provides object storage in the cloud. It allows storage of files from 0-5TB in size, and offers storage for unlimited number of items. 

# Buckets
S3 buckets are containers for objects. They are used to identify the location of an object, and bucket names must be **globally unique**. 

General form of an S3 bucket URL: `https://s3-<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>`

## Bucket Security
All buckets are **private** by default. Access can be controlled via:
* **Bucket Policies** - policy documents which are applied at a bucket level. 
* **Access Control Lists** - applied at an object level.

## Logging
* Server access logging can be enabled for buckets.
* Object-level logging can be enabled to record any object-level API activity using AWS CloudTrail.

## Encryption
S3 allows automatic server-side object encryption. In-transit encryption is done via SSL/TLS.

For encryption at rest, AWS will handle encrypting the data while there are a few options for storing and managing the secret keys.

| Type | Who stores the secret | Who manages the secret | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SSE-AES/SSE-S3 | AWS S3 | AWS S3 | Each object has AES-256 encryption, with keys managed and regularly rotated by S3. |
| SSE-KMS (AWS-Managed CMK) | AWS KMS | AWS KMS | The secret key (AWS-Managed Customer Master Key aka CMK) is provided and fully managed by AWS KMS. Provides an audit trail to track whenever this key is used. |
| SSE-KMS (Customer-Managed CMK) | AWS | You | You manage the key using AWS KMS. This key gets referenced whenever encrypting and decrypting data in S3. Deleting the key will render all data encrypted with this key useless. |
| SSE-C | You | You | You administer and rotate your own secret keys (e.g. generated via OpenSSL). |

To **enforce encryption** on all objects that get uploaded to an S3 bucket, use an S3 bucket policy to deny all PUT requests that don't include the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` parameter in the request header. This parameter accepts one of two values:

* `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256` - for enabling SSE-S3 encryption
* `x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms` - for enabling SSE-KMS encryption

# S3 Objects
Objects in S3 consist of the following:

* **Key** - the unique name of the object
* **Value** - the content
* **Version ID** - allows for version control
* **Metadata** - any additional meaningful data e.g. Content-Type
* **Subresources** (specific to the bucket):
  * Bucket policies / ACLs
  * Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) - policies on accessing the contents of a bucket from another bucket
    * To allow a resource to access an object, add the resource's URL to the `<AllowedOrigin>` tag in the target bucket's 
  * Transfer Acceleration - uses CloudFront's wide distribution of edge locations to optimise transfer speeds

# Storage Tiers/Classes

| Tier | Durability | Availability | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | 99.99999999999% | 99.99% | Designed to sustain the loss of 2 facilities concurrently |
| IA | 99.99999999999% | 99.99% | Costs 20% less than S3 standard, but charges a retrieval fee. |
| One Zone IA | 99.99999999999% | 99.95% | Data is stored in 1 AZ, if it goes down you lose access to the data. |
| Glacier | 99.99999999999% | 99.99% | Very cheap; used for archival only. No real time access, takes 3-5 hours to restore data. |
| Reduced Redundancy Storage | 99.99% | 99.99% | Less durability, designed for data that can be recreated if lost (e.g. thumbnails). Currently being phased out by AWS. |

# Data Consistency Model
* **Read After Write Consistency** for PUTs of new objects i.e. after inserting an object for the first time, it is immediately accessible.
* **Eventual Consistency** for DELETEs and overwriting with PUTs i.e. updates may take some time to propagate.

# Replication
Replication is a bucket-level configuration that enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across S3 buckets.

* **Cross-Region Replication** (CRR) - copy objects across buckets in different regions
* **Same-Region Replication** (SRR) - copy objects across buckets in the same region

Cross-Region Replication requires the following conditions:
* The source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.
* The source and destination buckets must be in different AWS Regions.
* Amazon S3 must have permissions to replicate objects from that source bucket to the destination bucket on your behalf.
